## General Information

The project "Development Aid and Social Dynamics" is funded by the Swiss National Science Fund (Schweizer National Fonds / Fond Nationale Suisse) under project number `100018_140745`.

The project is headed by Professor Jean-Louis Arcand of The Graduate Institute in Geneva.

The project is administered by The Graduate Institute's Centre of Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding, specifically by Dr. Oliver Jutkersonke (CCDP Head of Research) and M. Sandra Reimann.

Three PhD Candidates under the supervision of Prof. Arcand have worked on the research project. Initially Matthias Rieger and Tu Chi Nguyen. Eventually Bastiaan Quast.

In collaboration with Matthieu Stigler the RDDtools package was developed for the analysis done here. A revised version of this package is published here as `rddtools` (maintained by Bastiaan Quast).
